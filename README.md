<h3 style="font-weight:bold">Feature 1</h3>

![image2](assets/mockups/home.JPG)

- Home page, users are introduced to the app and can then move to the create entry screen where they can enter into a cocktail comp and compete

### Feature 3

![image7](assets/mockups/createEntry.JPG)

- Users can create a cocktail entry by uploading the details and an image of their creation, along with some details about the ingredients and other important information so users can try the recipes at home for themselves!
- Users being able to try the cocktails out is the entire premise of the app, teaching keen learners a new hobbie!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

The concept originated from my job. I work as a bartender at a high end establishment and always felt the need for customers to have the ability to visit the shop,
have a cocktail and then rate it on an app of some sort, thus my idea was born!

### Road Map and conceptual process

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

- I spent a lot of time on apps that were in line with what i was trying to create, i.e restaurants, bars etc and went through the functionality and how the app was going to work
- A lot of the process went towards and was guided around the question of **how can i make this a real world application?** **what do i need to do for this app to be world ready?**
- I also accepted this as a growing project, one i can keep bettering and working on, there are so many options and ideas i have to add to this project

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- A big part of the process was getting familiar with Expo and the world of mobile development and getting familiar with working on android and ios.

#### Above And Beyond

**Going above and beyond the brief**

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- Search functionality
- Comment section where users can visit the individual entries and leave comments on their fellow competitors drinks
- Google login and verification (todo)
- Lottie animations

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- In future i would like to publish the app to the app store, Firebase could be an issue however with calls to the db. I'd really like to create something real world ready.
- Functionality to login with a Google account
- Google reviews?
