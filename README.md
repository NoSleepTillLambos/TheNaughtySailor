<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
## Concept Process

### Road Map and conceptual process
**The concept originated from my job. I work as a bartender at a high end establishment and always felt the need for customers to have the ability to visit the shop,
have a cocktail and then rate it on an app of some sort, thus my idea was born! | I wanted users to learn from people in the industry**
</br>
</br>

<br/>

## Development Process

- I spent a lot of time on apps that were in line with what i was trying to create, i.e restaurants, bars etc and went through the functionality and how the app was going to work
- A lot of the process went towards and was guided around the question of **how can i make this a real world application?** **what do i need to do for this app to be world ready?**
- I also accepted this as a growing project, one i can keep bettering and working on. There are so many options and ideas i want to add to this project in the future

### Implementation Process 

<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- A big part of the process was getting familiar with Expo and the world of mobile development and getting familiar with working on android and ios.
- The project is very frontend orientated especially as my first app that i am developing i wanted it to be as thought out as possible with every little piece to be tailormade.

#### Above And Beyond

**Going above and beyond the brief**

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- **Lottie animations**
- **Onboarding screens**

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- **Search functionality**
- **Comment section where users can visit the individual entries and leave comments on their fellow competitors drinks**
- **Google login and verification**
- **Skeleton loading animations, they add a great touch to the UI and the experience of the app**
