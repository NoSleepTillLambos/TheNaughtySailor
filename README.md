### Feature 2

Login functionality that prevents a user from logging into without the correct credentials and accessing the database and data within

### Feature 3

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

My main source of inspiration was drawn from Axie infinity, so a lot of my inspiration was designed around them and their website and agenda
Its a game i have quite a lot of experience using and a lot of time within the app so it helped a lot with my designs.

### Road Map and conceptual process

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

I had to decide what my project was going to be based on and what the general theme would be. <br/> from playing Axie a lot
and with the general idea being the same as what was expected of us in the brief i decided to base it off this.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- A big part of the process was getting familiar with Expo and the world of mobile development and getting familiar with working on android and ios.

#### Above And Beyond

Going above and beyond the brief

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- Search functionality

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- In the future i would love to incorporate real world blockchain technology and maintain users funds.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
